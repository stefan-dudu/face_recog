# Face Recognition App

Using the power of the AI, this app is able to return probability scores on the likelihood that the image contains human faces and coordinate locations of where those faces appear with a bounding box.

## 

This application was created using Ract.js alongside with an image recognition API. It also includes concepts like Sign In, creating a user and a fully responsive interface.
